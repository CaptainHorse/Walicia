# Wallicia
Wallicia is an application that allows rendering various things on your desktop under the icons.</br>
Wallicia also has a "buddy mode" so you can have your favourite video play wherever you like. If you video has a black background it will be transparent, allowing for possibilities such as having your favourite character dance on the screen.
