# Wallicia
Wallicia is an application that allows playing videos on your desktop under the icons.</br>
Wallicia also has a "buddy mode" so you can have your favourite video play wherever you like. Wallicia control panel can be closed and will stay nicely in your tray so you can re-open it or close the whole application. ~~If you video has a black background it will be transparent, allowing for possibilities such as having your favourite character dance on the screen.~~ Currently broken for videos with true alpha channel.
